<h1>WELCOME TO MY WEBPAGE </h1>
<h2> Jamila Frederick </h2> <br> <br>
<p class="paragraph"> My name is Jamila Frederick. I was born on Sunday April 23, 2000 in Brooklyn, New York. I am the youngest out of my two older
brothers. I come from a very cultural background. My mom is Jamaican and my dad is Trinidadian.I am a sophomore at Pace
University in Manhattan, New York majoring in Biology and possibly minoring in psychology. My near future occupation is a
pediatrician.Why pediatrics? I really have a soft spot for kids and know I will do everything in my power to take good
care of them. Every since I was a kid-going to my yearly checkups- I would tell my doctor that one day I would too
become a great doctor. And ever since then my mind has been set, nothing has changed.</p> <br> <br>
